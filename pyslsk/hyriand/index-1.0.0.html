<h3>Credits:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>SmackleFunky</b> for his poetry-like patch that added remembered
searches (which, slightly modified, turned into autosearch), ignoring and
PM history. Fall down on your knees and praise the all-mighty SmackleFunky!
<li><b>Wretched</b>, <b>daelstorm</b> and <b>anadyr</b> for sacrificing
themselves and their computers to test my patches before you get them and
giving me hints and tips on stuff I should (not) do. You should also thank
or curse Wretched for the search filter help :-)
<li><b>geertk</b> for his excellent recursive directory and hostname lookup
patches (although the reverse lookup has been introduced in pyslsk-1.0.0 as
a standard feature) and the how-to-apply-a-patch mini-guide.
<li><b>ddbsa</b> for his excellent search filtering patch
<li><b>alexbk</b> for creating pyslsk, and keeping me sharp by making sure
lots of hunks of my patch fail against any new release.

<h3>Added features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Auto-search. Hint: check the "remember" box
<li>Ignoring users (in chats and PM's) (<b>/ignore /unignore</b> and settings
dialog)
<li>PM history (will show the last 15 lines of a conversation if loggin is
enabled)
<li>Search filtering (see new help screen)
<li>Buttons on the user info are placed nicer
<li>Set a fixed number of upload slots (optional of course)
<li>Recursive directory downloading (thanks to geertk)
<li>Command aliasing.. Create your own / commands. See below for syntaxis
<li>GB/MB/KB filesizes in the transfers list
<li>Locale-independant decimal separators
<li>Configurable text colours for chats and search results
<li>Allow people on your user list to be scheduled for uploads ahead of
regular users (see the transfers tab in the settings dialog)
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Command aliasing</h3>
This patch will allow you to create your own / commands.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Examples:<br>
<b>/alias np np: |(cat /tmp/xmms-info | grep "Title: " | sed "s/Title: //")</b><br>
This will create a new /np command which you can use in chat
windows. It will parse the XMMS Info-Pipe plugin file. And
show something like <b>np: Ivory Frequency - Dancing Troops</b><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>/alias slap /me slaps $(1) with $(2:)</b><br>
This will create a new /slap command. $(1) means "first
parameter after the command",  $(2:) means "second parameter
and everything after that". So <b>/slap hyriand a cannonball</b>
would be expanded to <b>/me slaps hyriand with a cannonball</b>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>/alias slap /me slaps $(1=himself) with $(2:=a cannonball)</b><br>
Same as above, but with default values for the parameters...<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>/alias run |($@)</b><br>
Inside a pipe |( ), you can use $@ to be expanded to all arguments
given to the /command.. So <b>/run uptime</b> will print your
current uptime to the chat. You can also use $1, $2, etc...<br>
&nbsp;<br>
To display all aliases currently configured, type:<br>
<b>/alias</b><br>
To show the definition of the "slap" alias, type:<br>
<b>/alias slap</b><br>
To delete the "slap" alias, type:<br>
<b>/unalias slap</b><br>
&nbsp;<br>

<h3>Applying the patch</h3>
1. When running from a source tarball:<br>
<pre>
cd /usr/local/src/pyslsk-1.0.0
patch -p1 < /the/path/to/pyslsk-1.0.0-hyriand-X.patch
</pre>
And that's all.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
2. When running an installed version (e.g. rpm or deb):<br>
&nbsp;<br>
logged in as root do:<br>
<pre>
cd /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages
patch -p1 < /the/path/to/pyslsk-1.0.0-hyriand-X.patch
</pre>
When you patch a binary packaged version you might get 1 or 2 errors when
applying then patch because patch can't find 2 files. You can safely ignore
this.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When that's done pyslsk should be started as root once to get the
appropiate .pyc files in place.  You won't have permissions to generate
them when not running as root.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
On <b>debian</b> the path will be "<b>/usr/lib/site-python</b>" instead
of "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages" (Red Hat/Mandrake/Gentoo).<br>
